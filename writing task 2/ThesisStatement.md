We should take *one side* of the argument.

Example 1:
In my view, the advantages of international tourism do outweigh the disadvantages, particulary in the areas of economic impact and cross-cultural communication.

So, we get the topic of BP1 and BP2:
BP1: economic impact
BP2: cross-cultural communication

Example 2:
In my opinion, the advantages of international tourism are less important than the disadvantages, especially in the areas of carbon emissions and the rich-poor divide.

BP1: carbon emissions
BP2: rich-poor divide

Challenge 1: Write a thesis statement for the question below. For this type of question, you can take *one or both* sides.

Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. *To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?*

*In my view, this is not true. The thing is that many life problems which low-income families' children might come across are not a big deal to those children who come from rich family.*

In my opinion, children from poor families are better at dealing with some challenges, like *controlling their speding*, but worse at other challenges, like *interpersonal relationships*.

In my opinion, while the student's attitude is significant, another crucial area is the quality of teaching they receive.

BP1: student's attitude
BP2: the quality of teaching

The data given displays the number of McGill University students who gave good ratings for different areas of the university in the years 2005, 2010 and 2015. Generally speaking, most aspects of McGill’s services stayed at roughly the same rating during the time period, although there were big changes in the areas of ‘student services’ and ‘range of modules offered.’

There was a huge rise in the rating given by students for ‘student services’ between 2005 and 2015. While that area received only 54% approval in 2005, Its rating surged to 81% in 2010 and increased again to 95% in 2015. In contrast, the rating received by ‘range of modules offered’ declined consistently over the time period. It started with 39% approval in 2005, but fell by 8% to 31% in 2010, and then dropped by 6% to 25% in 2015.

The areas of ‘teaching quality’ and ‘library resources’ both fluctuated slightly across the three dates. ‘Teaching quality’ fell marginally from 74% to 72% in 2010, but then enjoyed an increase of 6% to 78% in 2015. On other hand, ‘library resources’ climbed by 2% between 2005 and 2010, but then declined by 1% to 87% in 2015. Meanwhile, there was no change in the rating of ‘sports and social facilities’, as it stayed at 65% approval in all three years.

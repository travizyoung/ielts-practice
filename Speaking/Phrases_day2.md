### Boring things
monotonous
emotional involvement
even the slightest bit bored
my brain's ability to endure boredom
a vicious cycle
perhaps the most tedious individual that I've ever had the misfortune of meeting
drone on
mental torture
riveting
as dull as dishwater

### Collecting things
a minimalist
physical possessions
keep something to the bare minimum
clog up
a load of old clutter
mementos
scrapbook
emotional resonance
a deceased relative
get rid of it on a whim
keep something close at hand
I might need it at a moment's notice
far greater intervals

### Computers
a digital element
fully disconnect
instantly hooked
first exposure
world processing
be thrust into something/somewhere
a shock to the system
inane
tranquility
a power outage
solar-powered devices

### Evening
a morning person
attack the day
my caffeine hit
sluggish
lethargic
early to bed, early to rise
wind down
get an early night
something required my attention
stress myself out
